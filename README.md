# Hi there 👋 I'm Yael. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from Wesleyan University, my Master of Science in Biostatics and Data Science from Weill Cornell Medicine. I am passionate about applying quantitative methods to clinical and public health questions using real-world healthcare data. 

You can see some of my projects at the links below:

## 📁 Projects

- **[Capstone Project](./capstone-project/)** In this project, I analyzed the impact of metformin on immunotherapy outcomes among breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes. I processed, cleaned, and quality checked over 15 relational datasets from TriNetX databases for analysis using R, and created reproducible workflows and data dictionaries for newly derived variables. I performed exploratory data analysis, survival analysis, and built multivariable regression models in R, and collaborated with students and advisers at Weill Cornell to resolve data challenges, discuss methodology, and produce weekly and ad-hoc deliverables, visualizations, and statistical analyses.
- **[Predicting Intubation within 5 days of Hospitalization for COVID-19 Patients](./predicting-intubation/)**
- **[Claims Data Analysis in SQL](./claims-data-analysis/)**
- **[Study of CPR during Cardiac Arrest](./cardiac-arrest-eda/)** In this report, we observed the relationship between EtCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide) and AMC (area of maximum compression) to understanding the quality of chest compression during CPR. This study focuses on 2 primary areas of compression, the left ventricle (LV) and the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT)/aortic root, and how compression over these AMCs impact EtCO2 levels and whether this impact changes by the CPR patients’ pre existing medical conditions, such as coronary artery disease, congestive hearth failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction. The data set consists of 129 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrests where transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging was employed during CPR. We performed exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and ANOVA tests in R.
