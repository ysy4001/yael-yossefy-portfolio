# Hi there 👋 I'm Yael. 

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from Wesleyan University, my Master of Science in Biostatics and Data Science from Weill Cornell Medicine. I am passionate about applying quantitative methods to clinical and public health questions using real-world healthcare data. 

You can see some of my projects at the links below:

## 📁 Projects

- **[Capstone Project](./capstone-project/)** In this project, I analyzed the impact of metformin on immunotherapy outcomes among breast cancer patients with type 2 diabetes. I processed, cleaned, and quality checked over 15 relational datasets from TriNetX databases for analysis using R, and created reproducible workflows and data dictionaries for newly derived variables. I performed exploratory data analysis, survival analysis, and built multivariable regression models in R, and collaborated with students and advisers at Weill Cornell to resolve data challenges, discuss methodology, and produce weekly and ad-hoc deliverables, visualizations, and statistical analyses.
- **[Predicting Intubation within 5 days of Hospitalization for COVID-19 Patients](./predicting-intubation/)** In this final project, I employed several statistical learning methods (Decision Trees, SVMs, Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, etc) to predict whether a COVID-19 patient will require intubation or mechanical ventilation within the first five days of hospitalization. This involved data cleaning and feature engineering in R, using baseline characteristics and vital signs of 1,345 COVID-19 positive patients.
- **[Claims Data Analysis in SQL](./claims-data-analysis/)** In this assignment, I analyzed inpatient, outpatient, and beneficiary claims data in SQL of patients who were enrolled in Medicare, had complete coverage of Part A and B from 2008-2010, and were alive by the end of 2010. 
- **[Study of CPR during Cardiac Arrest](./cardiac-arrest-eda/)** In this report, we observed the relationship between EtCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide) and AMC (area of maximum compression) to understanding the quality of chest compression during CPR. This study focuses on 2 primary areas of compression, the left ventricle (LV) and the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT)/aortic root, and how compression over these AMCs impact EtCO2 levels and whether this impact changes by the CPR patients’ pre existing medical conditions, such as coronary artery disease, congestive hearth failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction. The data set consists of 129 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrests where transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging was employed during CPR. We performed exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and ANOVA tests in R.
- **[Healthcare Workforce Wellness Databases](./healthcare-workforce-wellness-database/)** This project models a workforce tracking system designed for use in a healthcare organization. The goal is to help leadership monitor employee wellness, assess employment trends over time, and support decisions related to staffing, resource allocation, and organizational well-being. This involved creating four relational databases, employee demographics, employment history, job categories, and welness tracking, populating them with mock data, creating appropriate triggers and indexes, and running SQL queries to answer questions of interest about burnout, overtime, promotions, turnovers, and other workforce wellness trends and relationships.
