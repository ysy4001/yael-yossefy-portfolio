This project models a workforce tracking system designed for use in a healthcare organization. The goal is to help leadership monitor employee wellness, assess employment trends over time, and support decisions related to staffing, resource allocation, and organizational well-being. This involved creating four relational databases, employee demographics, employment history, job categories, and welness tracking, populating them with mock data, creating appropriate triggers and indexes, and running SQL queries to answer questions of interest about burnout, overtime, promotions, turnovers, and other workforce wellness trends and relationships. This folder includes: a **[SQL file](./healthcare-workforce-wellness-database/workforce_wellness_project.sql)** with the databases and queries, a **[Description Document](./healthcare-workforce-wellness-database/workforce_wellness_project_description.docx)**
