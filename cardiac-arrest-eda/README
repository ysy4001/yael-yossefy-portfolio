In this report, we observed the relationship between EtCO2 (end-tidal carbon dioxide) and AMC (area of maximum compression) to understanding the quality of chest compression during CPR. This study focuses on 2 primary areas of compression, the left ventricle (LV) and the left ventricle outflow tract (LVOT)/aortic root, and how compression over these AMCs impact EtCO2 levels and whether this impact changes by the CPR patients’ pre existing medical conditions, such as coronary artery disease, congestive hearth failure, chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus and myocardial infarction. The data set consists of 129 cases of in-hospital cardiac arrests where transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) imaging was employed during CPR. This advanced imaging technique is used to identify the specific area of the chest targeted for compression to precisely classify the AMC - LV or LVOT.
