In this final project, I employed several statistical learning methods (Decision Trees, SVMs, Logistic Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net, etc) to predict whether a COVID-19 patient will require 
intubation or mechanical ventilation within the first five days of hospitalization. This involved data cleaning and feature engineering, using baseline characteristics and vital signs of 1,345 COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized at New 
York-Presbyterian Hospital.
